# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with Deep Learning

## Introduction

**Problem Statement:** Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye disease that affects the blood vessels in the retina. It is a leading cause of blindness in diabetic individuals. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial in preventing vision loss. Deep learning models have shown promise in automating the classification of diabetic retinopathy into different severity categories from retinal images.

In this project, I aim to develop a deep learning model for the automated classification of diabetic retinopathy into five categories.

## Dataset

**Dataset Source:** Kaggle

**Dataset Description:** I will be using a Kaggle dataset of retinal images containing cases from all five diabetic retinopathy categories. The dataset is labeled with information about the severity of diabetic retinopathy. It is essential to have a reliable and well-annotated dataset for training and evaluating my model.

## Environment

**Notebook Environment:** Kaggle Jupyter Notebook

**Accelerated Computing:** I will utilize a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) VM with specifications for efficient deep learning computations, specifically the TPU VM v3.8.

## Model Architecture

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** My model will be based on CNNs, which are highly effective for image classification tasks. I will experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance in classifying diabetic retinopathy.

## Evaluation

**Performance Metrics:** I will evaluate the model's performance using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices for each severity category.

**Clinical Interpretation:** Additionally, I will consider clinical validation and interpretation of the results to assess the model's practical utility in assisting healthcare professionals.
